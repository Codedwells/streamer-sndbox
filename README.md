# Streamer Sandbox

Streamer Sandbox is a versatile project designed to handle video streaming and file uploads efficiently. It leverages modern technologies to provide a robust and scalable solution for managing video content.

## Features

- **Video Streaming**: Supports HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) for adaptive bitrate streaming.
- **Multiple Packager Options**: Choose between FFmpeg or Google's Shaka Packager for HLS content.
- **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming**: Provides multiple quality levels when using Shaka Packager.
- **Quality Selection**: Interactive quality selector for videos transcoded with Shaka Packager.
- **File Uploads**: Handles file uploads with ease, including large files.
- **AWS S3 Integration**: Utilizes AWS S3 for secure and scalable storage.
- **Dockerized Environment**: Simplifies development and deployment with Docker.
- **TypeScript Support**: Ensures type safety and modern JavaScript features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Docker
- AWS account (for S3 integration)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/streamer-sandbox.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your AWS credentials and other necessary configurations.

## Packager Options

### FFmpeg (Default)

FFmpeg is used by default to generate HLS content. It produces a basic HLS stream with segments.

### Google Shaka Packager

Shaka Packager is an advanced media packaging tool that offers:

- Multiple video qualities (low, medium, high)
- Adaptive bitrate streaming
- DASH and HLS support from the same source content
- Interactive quality selection in the player
- Better compatibility with various players and devices

When using Shaka Packager, the system will:

1. Create multiple quality renditions of your video
2. Generate both DASH and HLS manifests
3. Add quality selection controls to the player
4. Store packaging metadata for better organization
